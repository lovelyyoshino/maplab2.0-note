## VersaVIS

VersaVIS provides a complete, open-source hardware, firmware and software bundle to perform time synchronization of multiple cameras with an IMU featuring exposure compensation, host clock translation and independent and stereo camera triggering.

It enables visual-inertial mapping using your own custom setup of cameras and IMU by triggering and time synchronization all sensors.
